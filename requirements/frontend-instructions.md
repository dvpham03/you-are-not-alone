# Project Overview
Use this guide to build the following mobile app. You Are Not Alone is a mobile application designed to connect individuals through shared personal experiences, particularly those involving emotional struggles. Inspired by platforms like Bumble, the app focuses on fostering empathy and support by matching users based on the content and themes of their submitted stories.

Users create a profile and submit a personal story related to challenges such as grief, trauma, illness, or stress. These stories are categorized using a language model-based classification system, which enables the app to suggest meaningful connections with others who have gone through similar experiences.
